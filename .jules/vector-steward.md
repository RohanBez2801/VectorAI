## Log

### [INIT] Boundary Agent Activation
- **Status**: Active
- **Observation**:
    - The VECTOR-BOUNDARY agent has been activated to enforce V2.1 scope.
    - **Discrepancy Detected**: `README.md` declares "Version: 2.0.0", but the boundary constraints mandate compliance with "V2.1 scope".
    - **Action**: Logging this discrepancy. Future monitoring will ensure new features do not exceed V2.1 capabilities without explicit approval.
