## 2026-05-22 – [Governor Bypass in Plugin Execution]

**Learning:** The `IntentClassifier` validates user intent at the start of the chat, but the actual tool arguments generated by the LLM were not being validated against the `TaskGovernor`. This meant that if the LLM generated a blacklisted command (e.g., via prompt injection or hallucination), the only safeguard was the user's manual approval in the UI. Automated safety layers were effectively bypassed for the most critical step: execution.

**Risk:** A "benign" user request could result in a "dangerous" tool execution if the LLM malfunctions or is manipulated. The system would present this dangerous action to the user for approval, creating a high-risk HITL failure mode (alert fatigue / accidental click).

**Mitigation:** Inject `ITaskGovernor` directly into `ShellPlugin`, `FileSystemPlugin`, and `DeveloperConsolePlugin`. Enforce `ValidateAction` on the actual generated arguments *before* requesting user approval. This ensures the "Defense in Depth" strategy holds—automated checks must pass before human checks are even requested.
